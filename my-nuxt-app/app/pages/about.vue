        currently we are on the about page, this is the about page of our simple nuxt app, we will add more content to this page later, but for now we just want to see how to create a simple page in nuxt and how to navigate between pages in nuxt, so we will keep it simple for now, but we will add more content to this page later, so stay tuned for that.
